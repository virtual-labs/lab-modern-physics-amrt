    "introduction": "The Modern Physics Virtual Lab is an innovative online learning environment designed to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and experimental validation in modern physics. This virtual lab provides students with hands-on experience in exploring quantum phenomena and atomic-scale physics through interactive simulations.<br>Each simulation within this lab replicates historically significant experiments that underpin modern physics, allowing learners to investigate key principles such as the quantization of energy, wave-particle duality, photon interactions, and the discrete nature of electric charge. By simulating real-time data collection and analysis, the virtual lab ensures that learners grasp both conceptual understanding and experimental methodology without the constraints of physical resources or safety concerns.",
